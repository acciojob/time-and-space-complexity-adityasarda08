    <h1>Time, Space, and Complexity</h1>

    <p>
        Time complexity measures how the runtime of an algorithm increases as the input size grows. Understanding time complexity helps developers write more efficient programs.

    <p>
        <b>Space Complexity</b> refers to the amount of memory an algorithm uses relative to the input size. For example, an algorithm may have a Space Complexity of O(n), meaning it requires memory proportional to the input size.
